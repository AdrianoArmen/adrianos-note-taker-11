## GitHub Repository 🚀

## Heroku Deployment 📦

- [App Deploy Link](https://evening-ocean-90274.herokuapp.com/)

## Project Description 📋
This simple note-taking application was designed with provided front-end code. It is designed to showcase my knowledge of [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/es/) servers combined with JSON file processing to fetch and retrieve desired data by routing. The back-end code was developed with the expectation of deploying the final app on [Heroku](https://heroku.com/). Middleware concepts were essential to build the app functionality as well as [UUIDv4](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuidv4) implementation for id data.

## Mock-Up 🔍

The following images show the web application's desired appearance and functionality:
